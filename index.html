      <strong>Elephants </strong>are known for their<em> incredible memory.</em>
      Matriarchs will remember the trails and watering holes
      and how to navigate the seasons,
      all knowledge handed down by their ancestors for generations,
      and knowledge so vital for their survival.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Elephants</strong> will <em>walk at the pace of their slowest member</em>,
      with infants surrounded by nurturing members of the herd,
      and their young babies are always protected from the elements,
      like the wind, the rain and the sun.
