    <p class="intro"><strong>Elephants</strong> communicate with a range of vocalizations,
      from low-frequency rumbles, known as infrasound, which humans can’t hear,
       to higher-pitched screams and trumpets. Other elephants can hear these vocalizations
       as much as six miles away. This allows them to keep in touch when apart
       and also enables them to recognise if an elephant is a friend. If not,
       they gather together for protection.
    </p>

    <div class="test-box"><strong>Elephants</strong> are a key stone species, which means without them,
      entire ecosystems would look dramatically different or cease to exist. In the case of an elephant,
      their dietary habits and movements help control an ecosystem
      and create new habitats other animals including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest,
       as well as smaller animals and insects.</div>

    <p class="line1"><strong>Elephants</strong> are sensitive and complex social animals
      who seek the companionship of other elephants, preferably their own families.
      With a life span of 70-80 years, elephants will grieve and mourn when a herd member dies
       and elephants have been observed visiting the bones of deceased herd members
       and touching these with their trunks.
     </p>

     <p id="line2">With <strong>females </strong>remaining with their herd for their entire lives
        and bulls forming ‘bachelor herds’ made up of other males,
        it is clear that elephants form close bonds of friendship.
        They have even been known to care for an orphaned elephant
        even if the infant is not related to the herd,
        although if a mother is already nursing her own calf,
        the chance of this reduces.
      </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Elephants </strong>are known for their<em> incredible memory.</em>
      Matriarchs will remember the trails and watering holes
      and how to navigate the seasons,
      all knowledge handed down by their ancestors for generations,
      and knowledge so vital for their survival.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Elephants</strong> will <em>walk at the pace of their slowest member</em>,
      with infants surrounded by nurturing members of the herd,
      and their young babies are always protected from the elements,
      like the wind, the rain and the sun.
